# xv6-Command-History-Enhancement
xv6 now includes command history support, enabling users to view and reuse previous commands. Navigation through history is managed with Shift + Arrow Up/Down. The system retains the last 3 executed commands, displays them in green, and excludes empty commands, allowing them to be executed again.
