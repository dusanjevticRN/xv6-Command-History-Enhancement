# xv6-Command-History-Enhancement
I have added command history support to xv6, allowing users to view and reuse previously executed commands. Navigation through the command history is managed with Shift + Arrow Up/Down. The system retains the last 3 executed commands, displays them in green, and excludes empty commands, making it easy for users to execute them again.
